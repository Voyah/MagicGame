____________________________________

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31
2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this
license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects
that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific
dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use".
Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so
as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility
and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition. Please see our
Copyright FAQ for common questions about using materials from our site,
including specific terms and conditions for packages like libwww, Amaya, and
Jigsaw. Other questions about this notice can be directed to
